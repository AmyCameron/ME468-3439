# Python and Matlab simulations

NOTE: the 8\_DOF and 14\_DOF files are not finished, I need to convert the ode45 functions to solve\_ivp or a similar function, and have had trouble doing so.

## Running Python

You should be able to open any python file with python3 just by running 

```
python3 V_bicycle_sim_sine.py
```

## Running Matlab

You should be able to run any of these in matlab by opening the app, selecting the file, and clicking run.
